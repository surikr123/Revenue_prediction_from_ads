This challenge is the capstone project of the Summer Analytics, a primer course on Data Science, conducted by Consulting and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati in the summers.
The dataset is provided by DeltaX is the pioneering cross-channel digital advertising platform. The cloud-based platform leverages big data, user behavior, and machine learning algorithms to improve performance across the business funnel of advertisers.
## Problem statement: 
An advertiser on the platform (DeltaX) would like to estimate the performance of their campaign in the future. Imagine it is the first day of March and you are given the past performance data of ads between 1st August to 28th Feb. You are now tasked to predict an ad's future performance (revenue) between March 1st and March 15th.
## Model Performed:
1. XGBRegressor
2. GradientBoostingRegressor
3. Support vector Regressor
4. RandomForestRegressor
5. Nueral Network for regression
